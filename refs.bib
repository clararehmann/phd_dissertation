  title     = "Statistical tests of host-parasite cospeciation",
  author    = "Huelsenbeck, John P and Rannala, Bruce and Yang, Ziheng",
  abstract  = "A history of cospeciation (synchronous speciation) among
               ecologically associated, but otherwise distantly related,
               species is often revealed by a strong correspondence of their
               phylogenies. In this paper, we present several tests of
               cospeciation that use maximum-likelihood and Bayesian methods of
               phylogenetic estimation. The hypotheses tested include: (1)
               topological agreement of phylogenies for coevolving groups; (2)
               identical speciation times of associated species; and (3)
               identical evolutionary rates in genes of associated species.
               These tests are applied to examine a possible instance of
               host-parasite coevolution among pocket gophers and lice using
               mitochondrial COI DNA sequences. The observed differences
               between gopher and louse trees cannot be explained by sampling
               error and are consistent with a rate of host switching about
               one-third the host speciation rate. A subset of the gopher-louse
               data is consistent with a common history of evolution (i.e., the
               topologies and speciation times are identical). However, the
               relative rate of nucleotide substitution is two to four times
               higher in the lice than in the gophers.",

               for a group of host and parasite species is contained in the DNA
               sequences sampled from each. Here, we develop a Bayesian
               framework for the analysis of cospeciation. We suggest a simple
               model of host switching by a parasite on a host phylogeny in
               which host switching events are assumed to occur at a constant
               rate over the entire evolutionary history of associated hosts
               and parasites. The posterior probability density of the
               parameters of the model of host switching are evaluated
               numerically using Markov chain Monte Carlo. In particular, the
               method generates the probability density of the number of host
               switches and of the host switching rate. Moreover, the method
               provides information on the probability that an event of host
               switching is associated with a particular pair of branches. A
               Bayesian approach has several advantages over other methods for
               the analysis of cospeciation. In particular, it does not assume
               that the host or parasite phylogenies are known without error;
               many alternative phylogenies are sampled in proportion to their
               probability of being correct.",

  abstract  = "Information on the history of cospeciation and host switching
               for a group of host and parasite species is contained in the DNA
               sequences sampled from each. Here, we develop a Bayesian
               framework for the analysis of cospeciation. We suggest a simple
               model of host switching by a parasite on a host phylogeny in
               which host switching events are assumed to occur at a constant
               rate over the entire evolutionary history of associated hosts
               and parasites. The posterior probability density of the
               parameters of the model of host switching are evaluated
               numerically using Markov chain Monte Carlo. In particular, the
               method generates the probability density of the number of host
               switches and of the host switching rate. Moreover, the method
               provides information on the probability that an event of host
               switching is associated with a particular pair of branches. A
               Bayesian approach has several advantages over other methods for
               the analysis of cospeciation. In particular, it does not assume
               that the host or parasite phylogenies are known without error;
               many alternative phylogenies are sampled in proportion to their
               probability of being correct.",

They include tools for file format conversion and manipulation, sorting, querying, statistics, variant calling, and effect analysis amongst other methods.The first version appeared online 12 years ago and has been maintained and further developed ever since, with many new features and improvements added over the years. The SAMtools and BCFtools packages represent a unique collection of tools that have been used in numerous other software projects and countless genomic pipelines.Both SAMtools and BCFtools are freely available on GitHub under the permissive MIT licence, free for both non-commercial and commercial use. Both packages have been installed \\&gt;1 million times via Bioconda. The source code and documentation are available from https://www.htslib.org.}",
